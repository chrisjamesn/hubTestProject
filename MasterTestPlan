4.0 TESTING STRATEGY
	
	4.1 UI Testing
		
		Definition: The process of testing user interfaces (i.e. webpages) to ensure that they meet standards

		Tools: Selenium WebDriver

	4.2 Load Testing
		
		Definition: An example of performance testing (by which an application is tested to see if its performance meets quality standards), load testing gauges an application's ability to handle a high volume of users in a short-term event.

		Tools: JMeter

	4.3 Integration Testing: 
	
		Definition: Testing by which individual units are combined and tested as a group

		Tools: Python

	4.4 Unit Testing:

		Definition: Testing by which individual units are tested to ensure they meet quality standards.

		Tools: JUnit

	4.5 Security Testing

		Definition: Definition by which part of or an entirety of an application is tested against software hacking techniques.

		Tools: SoapUI

6.0 Test Deliverables

	6.1 Test Plan
	6.2 Test Cases
	6.3 Bug Reports
	6.4 Test Summary (date, events recorded)

7.0 Acceptance Criteria

	7.1 Selenium Tests: GitHub Profile Navigation, Category Sorting Navigation, Remikra Timeline Last Item.
		For each page...
		Success: Print "Navigation to <link> was a success!"
		Failure: Print "Driver failed to find the following link: <next_link>."
		
	7.2 JMeter Tests: Certificates Page Navigation Load, Duplicate Entry User Load, Timeline User Load
		Ideal Result: Zero errors produced during the process
		Acceptable Result: Each user reaches supposed HTML page that does not have errors (or "breaks") 

	7.3 Python Tests:
		Success: all JSON fields for each unit are filled and that each unit is unique from the others
		Failure: JSON units contain empty fields or are duplicates of one another

	7.4 JUnit Tests: 
		Success: "Assert true" statement is thrown for each case that passes
		Failure: "Assert false" statement is thrown for each case that does not pass

	7.5 SoapUI Tests:
		Success: The test fails, therefore, a hacker cannot do the acts accordingly to each test case
		Failure: The test succeeds, therefore, it is possible for a hacker to do the acts accordingly to each test case
