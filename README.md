# hubTestProject
A series of tests will be implemented to ensure the quality of theChrisNutterHub.com, and provide useful test templates for others to use on related projects.

Getting Started:
	This project will utilize the following tools: Selenium with Ruby, JMeter, Python, JUnit, and SoapUI.

	To Download Each Tool:
		Selenium with Ruby (for Mac): 
			Type the following prompts into Terminal:
				/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
				\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
				rvm install 2.7.1
				gem 'selenium-webdriver', '~> 3.142', '>= 3.142.7'
				gem install selenium-webdriver
			Go to https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases and go to "Assets". Download the file appropriate for your OS.
			Type the following prompt into Terminal: brew cask install chromedriver
			It is important to check and make sure Terminal is set to the correct Ruby version and working directory of the file you want to run.
			To check the version of Ruby, type the following Terminal command: ruby -v
			If you need to change to the correct version of Ruby, type the following Terminal command: export PATH=/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH
		JMeter: 
			Visit the following URL: https://lnkd.in/gdPggQQ
				Select the appropriate JRE ending in .dmg. You will have to create an Oracle Account and verify by email address in order for the download to carry through.
			Next, visit the following URL: https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi
				Under the "Binaries" section, download the file ending in .zip. Follow the prompts in the wizard that opens up.
		Python: https://www.python.org/downloads
		JUnit: http://junit.org/junit4/ . Under the "Welcome" header, click "Download and Install." Follow the instructions accordingly.
		SoapUI: https://www.soapui.org/downloads/soapui.html . Select the Open Source option and follow the installation prompts from the downloaded file.

Running the Tests:
	Copy and paste the code into your preferred code console. Make the changes necessary to configure the script to your trial/project. Follow the procedures according to each testing environment for the execution of each test.

Deployment:
	You may use my URL addresses in each test for practice trials unless otherwise indicated. However, you must receive written permission from me to use my URL addresses or parts of theChrisNutterHub.com for a project or practical application.

Built With:
	This ongoing project will be implemented with the use of my MacOS, theChrisNutterHub.com, Selenium with Ruby, JMeter, Python, JUnit, and SoapUI.

Authors: Christopher J Nutter

Changes:
	This ReadMe, along with the test plans and the test code content, is subject to change at any time depending on the needs of the ongoing project.
